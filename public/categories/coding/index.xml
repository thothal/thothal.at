      <description>A Short General Primer on LoopsIn my daily programming I barely use any base for loops. I used to rely on lapplyand friends a lot, then switched to the plyr family of apply functions and eventuallyended up using the purr::map_* family of functions.
There is a bit of overhead involved in mapand [lvs]apply can be faster / more efficient,but I do like the verbosity of map and friends as well as the possibility to uselambda functions via ~1.</description>

      <description>Sunburst GraphsI was recently looking for a neat way to display nested ratios. What do I mean bynested ratio? Well, imagine a taxonomy where you have different hierarchical levelsand you want to show the ratios of all levels simultaneously.
There are a couple of different ways of how to show these, like mosaic plots, tree plotsor sunburst charts.Despite being a close relative to the most despisedpie chart (of which Tuftehimself said that the only worse design than a pie chart is several of them1) theycan be useful - if you use them with care-2</description>

      <description>Hello WorldDuring my normal work day I spend quite some time reading coding related blog posts andskimming through questions on Stackoverflow (and - if time permits - answering some R or shiny related questions).
When I learn about a new topic or technique it can happen that I jump from one article toanother (and more often than not get side-tracked by yet another topic ü§¶Ô∏è).In one of those scavenger hunts I ended up reading onBlogdown and a quote was catching my attention:</description>
